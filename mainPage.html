			I was fighting inverted colon disease while pregnant with my first born. Not a great way to spend
			my thirties. The pain of the disease was constant, and the embarrasment of being confined to a
			wheel chair was too high. I refused to show my face in public, or meet with my friends or family.
			The only light in my life was my loving husband, who was with my every step of the way, and the
			promise of my future daughter, Linda. I felt guilty, but my husband was doing all the work around
			the house, cooking, cleaning, making repairs, you name it. He was such a great supporter during my
			grief. But, he couldn't stop my hope from slowly dying down. I thought no one could. And then, I 
			met Keegan Schmit. It was at a grocery store, and it was the first time I had gone into public in
			three months. The sheer coincidence that I had run into the only inverted colon doctor just proved
			to me that there is a God, and he made me get out of the house and meet Keegan. I told him my story, 
			and he told me his. I learned about his inverted colon research facility, and I asked him if I could
			be a test patient. He was hesitant at first, but agreed with my convincing. I went in that next day,
			and his very kind doctors performed on me. When I woke up after the surgery, my colon was healed, and
			I could walk again. I reconnected with my family, and gave birth to my child a week later. Keegan Schmit
			saved my life, physically and emotionally. I thank him so much, and I am now a donator and supporter of
			the Murderous Flounderesses. Thank you!

			After medical school, I didn't know what I wanted to do. My loving parents had encouraged 
			me to get my doctorate, but I couldn't find any jobs I really wanted to apply for. I
			took a few internships throughout California, and didn't stay at any of them for very
			long. I had reached a point of confusion and fear in my life. About 7 internships later, I came across
			the Murderous Flounderesses, an inverted colon research facility, and I fell in love.
			I was looking forward to waking up in the morning and making the long commute to work.
			Work had never seemed so important, or fun. It was like everything I was meant to do was
			put into a single job. The environment I was surrounded by, and the relationships I made
			was a dream come true. Our CEO, Keegan, helped me find a house nearer to work to help, 
			shorten my long driving hours and I am forever in his debt. He's a prime example of the 
			work community that has been established here at the Murderous Flounderesses. The work we
			do here is so impactful, I feel the effects everyday. I am a firm supporter of this cause,
			and you should be too.
