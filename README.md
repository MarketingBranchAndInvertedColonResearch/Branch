<p>In the Winter of 2011, eventual partners Keegan Schmit and Jackson Bullard stumbled across
			eachother at an intercollegiate tech competition. Both members were the captains of their team,
			Keegan's being Harvard University and Jackson Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After a 
			narrow win by Schmit, the two went to congratulate eachother, talked, and eventually became 
			friends. That night, Keegan Schmit pitched Jackson Bullard the idea of a bank software transaction
			system, which eventually was bought out by Citi Bank for 55 million dollars. Keegan and 
			Jackson then partnered on multiple startups and projects, accumulating a combined networth of
			1.3 billion in three years. Later in their career, the two hatched an idea for a research facility to
			cure a disease that was near and dear to their hearts, and is now to the world. The facility came to
			be known as The Murderous Flounderesses: Inverted Colon Research. The Murderous Flounderesses, 
			a non-profit organization, researches a disease, <i>Inverte Colonia Diverticula</i> (Inverted Colon Disease),
			which stems from an overuse of popular sexual techniques such as the fisting of the rectum. Starting with
			a team of 243 members, the organization has now grown to have 3000 team members, and 213,000 supporters. 
			Every day our core members thank you, the supporters, and hope to continue growth, as every one brings us
			slightly closer to abrogating this outrage of inverted colons.</p>
