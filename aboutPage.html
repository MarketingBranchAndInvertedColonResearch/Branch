	<p>In 2013, while partners Jackson Bullard and Keegan Schmit were attending Harvard University, they learned of an issue that has implanted itself in their hearts, and now the world.
	 This problem, the reversing of the colon's inward-facing direction, commonly known in Latin as <i>Colonia Inverte Diverticula</i>, is a disease that stems from the overuse of popular sexual
 techniques, such as the fisting of the rectum. Having much success in the past in the tech industry with their transaction related bank software, the team began on a project with their
  other company's revenue to start research branches to solve this nation wide problem of inverted colons. Ever since, the foundation, "The Murderous Flounderesses: Inverted Colon Research
   Branch", has not seized to slow or stop in any way, but has been generating thousands of supporters. Every day this organization thanks all of our supporters from the bottom of our 
   hearts. Because of you, we get closer and closer to accomplishing our goal of ending this outrage of inverted colons.</p>
